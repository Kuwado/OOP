      "content" : "The acronym NFT refers to Non-Fungible Token, which explains almost everything. As the crypto sphere begins to boom towards 2021, NFTs have already gained popularity. The piece of artwork shown is an NFT, as well as it was recently marketed for $60 million. Mike Winkelmann, better known by his pen name Beeple, produced digital art creation. It is a digital representation of all works of art he had created from 2013. Surprisingly, Everyday’s actual selling rate is set at a pitiful $110 beginning February 25th. Twenty buyers boosted the value to almost $1.2 million in the first nine minutes of bidding. The price range was rough, $15 million one hour, even before the auction concluded. The price has risen to $30 million in the last ten minutes only. The final price was established at $60.30 million, an additional $10 million for the Christie’s artwork sale, in the dying seconds."

NFTs are distinct digital tokens that signify ownership of specific digital or physical assets. Unlike well-known cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are non-fungible, meaning each one is entirely unique and cannot be directly swapped on a one-to-one basis. These tokens are commonly employed to represent various forms of digital assets, including digital art, collectibles, music, virtual real estate, and more."

Interestingly, many artists and creators are themselves involved in minting NFTs of their own work, bestowing ownership and authenticity upon the buyers. Yet, this peculiar situation begs the question: are these artists infringing on their own copyrights by selling digital renditions of their creations?"

      "blogHeading" : "Ownership and Provenance – A Delicate Balancing Act",
      "content" : "To navigate this intricate landscape, artists and creators must contemplate how they wish to handle the licensing of their work when creating NFTs. Some opt for exclusive licenses, thereby ensuring that they retain their rights and creative control. Others might decide to release their work under a Creative Commons license, which delineates the terms of NFT usage and determines the extent to which the artist retains certain rights over the work."

      "blogHeading" : "Smart Contracts and Licensing: A Ray of Hope",
      "content" : "One of the alluring aspects of NFTs is their capability to authenticate the origin and ownership history of a digital asset – a concept commonly referred to as “provenance.” Yet, this newfound transparency raises questions regarding the ownership of the underlying intellectual property.

These self-executing contracts can spell out the terms of use, specify how the NFT can be transferred, and even allocate royalties to the creator on secondary sales. For instance, an artist might stipulate that the NFT owner can exhibit the artwork in a virtual gallery but is prohibited from reproducing it for commercial purposes."

      "content" : "If you are into technology and blockchain, we’re sure you might have heard about NFTs. These unique digital tokens have caused a stir in the art and collectible market. But let’s face it, traditional non-fungible tokens can be extremely expensive for most of us. That’s where fractional NFTs come into the picture. They offer an affordable way to own a piece of a digital asset."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "How Do Fractional NFTs Work?",
      "content" : "Fractional NFTs are a game changer in the industry. They are paving the way for mass adoption by allowing us to participate in the digital economy. You might be wondering what exactly are these tokens and how they work. Well, that’s what we are going to explore in the present blog. We will also look at the potential benefits and challenges of fractional tokens. So, let’s get started."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "Benefits of Fractional NFTs",
      "content" : "Fractional NFTs are also known as “fractionalized” or “fractional ownership” of non-fungible tokens. They allow multiple people to own a portion of a non-fungible token. It’s like owning a slice of a pizza instead of the whole pie. This makes it easier for people to invest in high-value non-fungible tokens, which would otherwise be expensive and out of reach for most people."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "Democratization",
      "content" : "For example, let’s say there’s an NFT artwork worth $10,000. With this concept, instead of one person buying the whole artwork, multiple people can pool their money and collectively purchase fractions of that asset. Each person would then own a percentage of the asset and be entitled to a portion of its value."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "High Liquidity",
      "content" : "Think of it like owning a share of stock. But, instead of a company, you’re investing in a unique digital asset. And, these assets can range from digital art to a virtual land or even a tweet. Fractional NFTs offer numerous advantages for both buyers and sellers. They are becoming popular due to their flexibility and potential for investment diversification. As technology continues to grow in popularity, many believe that this innovation could revolutionize how we invest in digital assets."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "Price Discovery",
      "content" : "Since most of the NFTs are on Ethereum, let’s look at how fractional tokens work on Ethereum. They often use something called the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens. To fractionalize a non-fungible token, we first need to lock it in a smart contract. Then we need to break one ERC-721 token into multiple ERC-20 tokens. The owner can decide all the details such as the number of ERC-20 tokens, prices of each token, metadata, and other details."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "Increased Visibility for Creators",
      "content" : "Each ERC-20 token represents a portion of the original non-fungible token. As a result, it gives partial ownership of the asset to its holder. Once the traditional token is inside the smart contract, anyone can buy the ERC-20 tokens, aka pieces of the original token. We call these pieces Fractional NFTs or F-NFTs for short. The value of each ERC-20 token depends on the overall value of the original asset."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "4 Use Cases of Fractional NFTs",
      "content" : "However, this scenario is not just limited to the Ethereum blockchain. Fractionalizing non-fungible tokens work on any network with smart contracts and NFTs, like Polygon or Cardano. These tokens allow people to own a piece of a high-value token which could be too expensive to buy the whole asset. They also hold the potential to create new investment opportunities and collaborations."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "Art",
      "content" : "Most of the popular non-fungible tokens are very expensive. Fractional NFTs make these expensive tokens more affordable for us. This makes it possible for everyone to get involved and own a piece of the non-fungible token. When the price of a non-fungible token goes up, then all of its fractions become more valuable. If its value goes down, then the value of all the fractions also goes down. Fractional NFTs help democratize traditional tokens and make them accessible to everyone."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "Gaming",
      "content" : "The value of a non-fungible token is determined by how unique or rare it is. Since these tokens are unique, it can be difficult to buy and sell them. F-NFTs let people own non-fungible tokens together, which makes it easier to buy and sell them. If a non-fungible token is too expensive, you can break it into smaller parts so more people can buy it. Doing this helps a lot of us with buying and selling these tokens quickly. How easily we can buy or sell an asset is known as ‘liquidity’. Fractionalized non-fungible tokens help people buy the parts they want at the prices that work for them. This way, they increase the liquidity in the marketplaces."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "Metaverse",
      "content" : "Price discovery is an important aspect of non-fungible token markets. It helps stakeholders understand the right price for non-fungible tokens. It is a process by which we can determine the price based on market demand. When we mint a new token, it can be difficult to price it. However, fractionalizing it can make the process simpler. F-NFTs can be released in the market to be bid on. This provides a mechanism for price discovery that helps determine accurate pricing for non-fungible tokens. This process also helps in avoiding issues such as over or under-valuation of tokens."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "Real Estate",
      "content" : "Fractional NFTs offer improved liquidity and price discovery, which in turn attract more buyers. This increased demand leads to greater visibility and a wider audience for the creator. Usually, a single owner buys and holds a non-fungible token. There is often limited access to these assets, resulting in a reduced potential market. On the other hand, fractional tokens are split into smaller pieces and multiple people can buy them. This means that any single asset can have a far larger potential audience with increased accessibility."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "What are the Challenges of Fractional NFTs?",
      "content" : "Fractional non-fungible tokens make it easier for more people to own a piece of artwork at a lower cost. The artist can also benefit as they will receive a greater level of support from their fanbase. It is also possible to create digital versions of physical artwork. We can then fractionalize and sell them as non-fungible tokens. This provides the artist with an additional source of revenue and more exposure to their work."
    }, {
      "blogHeading" : "Conclusion",
      "content" : "Fractional NFTs are proving to be a boon for the gaming industry. They allow gamers to own a fraction of the token that would otherwise be too expensive for them to buy. You can also use these tokens in games as virtual currency. This way, players can trade and exchange fractional tokens with others. This opens up the possibility for gamers to gain access to non-fungible tokens that may otherwise be out of their price range."

Hence, it is a place where you can hang out, meet other people, check out NFTs and trade them with each other. Think of it like a socio-religious gathering of like-minded people. It is similar as the real-world events we see happening all around us today. An immersive experience with virtual reality headsets will make this happen. Hence, for now, we can rely on graphics and custom-built tools. This is to give a sense of community and ownership over our passions and interests on the internet. Likewise, think of NFT marketplaces as a more formal term suited to the internet we’ve built today.

Some prefer to go even more niche. Like permissioned networks for selected artists focused on Anime. Likewise, there are others who serve buyers interested in comics. Hence, it is up to you to decide how best you understand a particular market. Someone interested in food can study how NFTs work in the food market.

An economy consists of large numbers of people creating and consuming. In that sense, art is a perfect representation of a person’s creative work.

The structure of the art market is such that artists slog for years to survive, to make it big. With NFTs underpinned by blockchain technology, they no longer need to. Artists mint NFTs of their works on the blockchain, receive royalties for perpetuity. This is a game changer."

For instance, think of your browsing activity, comments, chats, purchases, and enquiries. All this data makes up your social profile. This data is nothing but you, yourself.

For many others, it’s revolutionary. The remaining don’t know what is going on and would like to know. Some don’t care and will not learn about NFTs unless compelled to. That’s the thing about new technology. It attracts different people, including speculators, pessimists, and optimists. Which one are you?"

A picture, an artwork, a video, a song, any creative work, etc. stored on the blockchain are NFTs. Each NFT is unique and its ownership is verifiable on the blockchain. No one can tamper with the record of transactions and activities. This is better than the real world, where fakes, counterfeits, and forgeries run amok."

Imagine a player who knows he or she won’t be available for the coming few days or weeks. So why not rent the NFT to someone who wants to make use of their NFT for playing the game better?"

If you do not know what staking is, don’t fret. Think of it as a mechanism to secure the network from malicious actors and to keep the network safe and running along. Every software needs to be updated from time to time so that the latest version of it is broadcast to users as fast as possible. So, think of Staking as the mechanism to update the state of the network to its latest version."

The ‘Milkha Singh’ collectibles will feature rare and exclusive NFTs, across SuperRare, Rare, Champion Collections, and Free Airdrops of the athlete’s sporting life.

NFTically’s global benchmarked technology smoothens the process out for collectors as well as creators selling their NFTs. Talking about the collaboration, Toshendra Sharma, Founder, and CEO, NFTically said, “NFTically is tremendously proud of this partnership with altiusDAO. We are certain that the Milkha Singh drop will be a turning point in showcasing how the sports industry can leverage NFTs in India. The first-ever NFT launch of Milkha Singh Ji, on the occasion of Republic Day, in itself is a gift to fans and NFT collectors.” Piyush Gupta, Advisor, altiusDAO said, “It has been wonderful to connect and partner with NFTically. The first in class technology solutions provided by NFTically removed any hurdles that could have come our way.” A significant portion of the proceeds generated from the sale of these NFTs would be donated to Milkha Charitable Trust for not just promoting sports but also helping those in need. Apart from the sprinter’s sports journey, the collectible NFTs in the drop comes with invaluable personal memorabilia of Milkha Singh. While the details of the same have been kept under wraps, they are bound to enthrall collectors and die-hard fans. The sentimental value of this drop also resonates with Milkha Singh’s son and Padma Shri awardee, Jeev Milkha Singh. “My father is an inspiration for not just me but for people across India. He wanted to go above and beyond for the country and this drop is the best way to honour his memory. With the joint efforts of NFTically and altiusDAO, I’m certain this NFT drop will help reach his legacy far and wide.”"

The best technologies become the new standard of industry and humanity. Now the whole cycle has to start again. This is because the rest of the market has caught up to the technology and now it’s not that valuable anymore. We need something new again.

    "text" : [ {
      "blogHeading" : "Use Layer-2 Sidechains and Blockchain Networks",
      "content" : "The growth of NFTs and decentralized finance has given rise to a global digital asset market. For the first time in history, we have an alternative to the traditional financial system. We know blockchains represent a way to sidestep intermediaries via open databases. 2021 was an exciting year for the uptake of NFTs. This is in part by the adoption of play-to-earn gaming and primary and secondary NFT artwork sales. Blockchain technology is on its way to more retail adoption in 2022. Besides, blockchains’ scalability issues and expensive gas fees on Ethereum have caused frictions. An added friction to interacting with the NFT world. The primary reason for high gas fees on the Ethereum network is congestion. Ethereum is the most popular blockchain network. Users have to pay miners to process their transactions faster and place them above the queue. Thus, jacking up the fees for everyone. Once Ethereum moves to the proof-of-stake model, we should see a downward trend in prices. Till then, we know about many ways to avoid expensive blockchain gas fees. We can direct our attention to the factors that play a role in verifying new transactions. The below section highlights some of the most popular ways to save gas fees when minting NFT artwork."

If the Axie team had relied on Ethereum, we would have seen many people unable to afford the high gas fees. As a result, there would have been lower levels of user activity and total value locked in the network. Currently, the most popular layer-2 sidechains and networks include Polygon Technology (previously Matic Network), Arbitrum and Optimism."

      "blogHeading" : "Find an NFT Tool that uses Lazy Minting",

We can expect users to get a fair idea about what their gas prices could be in the next few hours. Furthermore, you can also check the projections for that week or month. Once done, calculate how much it would cost in fiat currency by checking tools like the ETH gas station. As a result, we can time NFT submissions to the days or times when there are low levels of network congestion. This method is very useful when you are knowledge-ready about the NFT project’s plans. For instance, the day and time when your favourite or chosen NFT will is to drop. This avoids rush hours for an NFT transaction that you believe you can wait for a little more."

Furthermore, users will need to find out the fees for using the marketplace and secondary sales commissions."

Other blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, Cosmos, Tezos, and others are seeing growth in developers, decentralized applications, and users. Secondly, other chains work on consensus mechanisms that do not rely on proof-of-work, the main reason for the high gas fees on Ethereum. Gas fees are a fraction of the transaction cost on other chains. You can search for NFT projects and teams from other blockchains and potentially expand the number of good projects that lie within your sight. In time, your familiarity with the NFT space will help you spot the best ones."

They set gas fees to a flat model most of the time. Under the advanced tab of wallet settings, let gas fees be customizable per transaction. As a result, users will see a separate window that now shows gas fees for each transaction."
